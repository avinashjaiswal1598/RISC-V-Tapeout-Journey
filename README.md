# RISC-V Tapeout Journey - Week 1

## Week 1: RTL Design & Synthesis Foundations

### DAY 1 ‚Äì Introduction to Verilog RTL Design & Synthesis

#### a. Introduction to Open Source Simulator: Icarus Verilog (Iverilog)
- **Objective:**  
  Gain familiarity with Icarus Verilog as an open-source tool for compiling and simulating Verilog RTL designs.
- **Key Concepts:**  
  Icarus Verilog enables simulation of hardware modules before synthesis, helps in design verification, and works seamlessly with VCD output for visualization.

#### b. Labs: Using Iverilog and GTKWave
- **Simulation Workflow:**  
  - Write Verilog design and appropriate testbench files.
  - Compile both using `iverilog`, producing a simulation executable.  
    ```
    iverilog -o sim_out my_design.v my_testbench.v
    ```
  - Run the simulation and generate a VCD (Value Change Dump) file:  
    ```
    vvp sim_out
    ```
  - View waveforms with GTKWave for in-depth signal analysis:  
    ```
    gtkwave dump.vcd
    ```
- **Deliverable:**  
  

#### c. Introduction to Yosys and Logic Synthesis
- **Overview:**  
  Yosys is an open-source framework for Verilog RTL synthesis, transforming Verilog code into a gate-level netlist.
- **Flow:**  
  - Install Yosys and clone the Sky130 PDKs for open-source cell libraries.
  - Run Yosys scripts to synthesize designs targeting `sky130` libraries.
    ```
    yosys
    # In the Yosys prompt or via script:
    read_verilog my_design.v
    synth -top my_design
    dfflibmap -liberty sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
    write_verilog my_design_synth.v
    ```
- **Lab Activity:**  
  Synthesize a sample Verilog design, examine synthesized netlist, and include a brief note on synthesis optimizations made by Yosys.

---

### DAY 2 ‚Äì Timing Libraries, Synthesis Strategies, and Flop Coding Styles

#### a. Introduction to Timing Libraries
- **Purpose:**  
  Timing libraries (e.g., Liberty format `.lib` files) provide technology-specific timing, power, and functional details for each standard cell.
- **Importance:**  
  Essential for accurate gate-level synthesis and subsequent STA (Static Timing Analysis).

#### b. Hierarchical Vs Flat Synthesis
- **Hierarchical Synthesis:**  
  - Synthesis happens module-wise, preserving design partitions and module boundaries.
  - Easier for debugging large designs, but may miss some cross-boundary optimizations.
- **Flat Synthesis:**  
  - All RTL is flattened before synthesis, enabling cross-module optimizations.
  - Can result in better timing/area but at the cost of complexity in tracing.
- **Key Takeaway:**  
  Know when to choose hierarchical vs. flat based on design size and optimization goals.

#### c. Various Flop Coding Styles and Optimization
- **Flop (D Flip-Flop) Coding Styles:**  
  - Different ways to model synchronous (clocked) sequential circuits in RTL.
  - Example:  
    ```
    always @(posedge clk)
      q <= d;
    ```
  - Efficient coding simplifies synthesis and physical timing closure.
- **Optimization Notes:**  
  - Prefer synchronous resets, use consistent coding styles, and avoid latches unless explicitly needed.
  - Review the synthesized netlist to confirm flops are correctly inferred.
