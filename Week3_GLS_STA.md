✅ **Observation:**
Both waveforms show identical signal transitions and DAC output behavior.

> **Conclusion:** Functional and post-synthesis GLS outputs match perfectly → ✅ *Design functionally verified post-synthesis.*

## 🧮 Part 2 – Fundamentals of STA (Static Timing Analysis)

### 📘 Course Reference:
[STA Fundamentals – Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/vlsi-academy-sta-checks/?couponCode=F960AEDD365E0CD12546)

### 📒 Key Notes & Learnings:
- **Setup Time:** Minimum time before the clock edge when data must remain stable.
- **Hold Time:** Minimum time after the clock edge when data must remain stable.
- **Slack:** Difference between arrival time and expected time.
- min difference(min slack)= Arrival time - Required time
- max difference(max slack)=  Required time - Arrival time
  - Positive Slack → Timing met ✅
  - Negative Slack → Timing violation ⚠️
- **Clock Definition:** Defines the main timing reference; usually added via `create_clock` in STA.
- **Timing Path Components:** Launch flop → Combinational logic → Capture flop.
- **Types of Setup/hold analysis:**
  - reg2reg
  - in2reg
  - reg2out
  - in2out
  - clock gating
  - recovery/removal
  - data-to-data
  - latch(time borrow/time given)
- **Setup & Hold Violations:**
  - Setup violation → Path too slow
  - Hold violation → Path too fast
- **Fix Techniques:**
  - Adjust clock skew
  - Buffer insertion
  - Resize cells
- **Path-Based Analysis (PBA):** Analyzes individual critical paths instead of global constraints(it is the best time at node).
- **Graph Based Analysis (GBA):** It is the worst time at node.

📄 *This course provided a foundational understanding of STA terms, timing paths, and how OpenSTA performs analysis using netlist and SDC constraints.*

## 📊 Part 3 – Generate Timing Graphs with OpenSTA

### 🧠 Objective:
Perform basic timing analysis on the synthesized BabySoC netlist using OpenSTA to identify critical paths and calculate setup/hold slack.

### 🧰 Installation (if not already installed)
```bash
sudo apt-get install opensta -y
```

### 🗂️ Step 1: Load Netlist and Constraints and Perform Timing Analysis
Create a file named `run_sta.tcl`:

```bash
 cd ~/VSDBabySoC
 make sta
```


### 🧾 Step 2: Output of the OPenSTA tool

### 🧩 Observations:
- **Critical Path:** 
- **Slack Value:** 
- **Interpretation:**
  - If slack > 0 → Timing met ✅
  - If slack < 0 → Violation exists ⚠️ (requires optimization)
