<img width="733" height="491" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71c03229-039a-4104-b87d-4fdc287845ad" />


Welcome to the Week 0 setup! This week focuses on installing essential EDA tools for the RISC-V tapeout project.

## üö¶ Objective
Get your environment ready for the RISC-V tapeout journey by installing and testing the full toolchain for this course including Yosys, GTKWave, Iverilog, OpenSTA, Ngspice, Magic, OpenLANE, this repository aims to empower learners to:

- Understand and navigate the complete EDA tool ecosystem used in open-source VLSI design and RISC-V tapeout workflows.
- Confidently use each tool for tasks such as static timing analysis (OpenSTA), circuit simulation (Ngspice), physical layout design (Magic), and RTL-to-GDSII flow automation (OpenLANE).
- Apply foundational principles of digital design, verification, and backend physical implementation through hands-on tool usage.
- Develop troubleshooting skills to identify and resolve common setup and runtime issues.


## üóÇÔ∏è Tasks
- Install Yosys, GTKWave, Iverilog, OpenSTA, Ngspice, Magic, OpenLANE on Ubuntu
- Validate installations with sample command runs
- Document any issues faced and their fixes
  

## üìù Step-by-Step Guide

### Yosys Installation
**Yosys:** An open-source Verilog RTL synthesis tool that converts behavioral hardware designs into gate-level netlists.

sudo apt update
sudo apt install yosys
yosys -V # Check version

### GTKWave
**GTKWave:** A waveform viewer used to visualize simulation outputs and analyze digital signals during hardware verification.

sudo apt install gtkwave


### Iverilog
**Iverilog:** A free Verilog simulation and synthesis tool that compiles and runs hardware description language designs for testing and verification.

sudo apt install iverilog

## OpenSTA - Static Timing Analyzer

OpenSTA is a fast and open-source Static Timing Analyzer for VLSI designs.

### Installation (Ubuntu 22.04+)
sudo apt update
sudo apt install opensta
opensta --version # Verify installation

### Quick Start
Run `opensta` on your SDC and SPEF files to analyze timing.

---

## Ngspice - Circuit Simulator

Ngspice simulates analog electronic circuits using SPICE.

### Installation
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ngspice
ngspice -v # Check version

### Basic Test
Run `ngspice` and load a sample test circuit file `.cir`.

---

## Magic VLSI - Layout Tool

Magic is a classic, easy-to-use VLSI layout tool.

### Installation from source
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git build-essential tcl-dev tk-dev libx11-dev
git clone https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/magic.git
cd magic
./configure
make
sudo make install
magic -version

### Usage
Launch `magic` and start creating or editing layouts.

---

## OpenLANE - RTL to GDSII Flow Automation

OpenLANE automates the full digital ASIC flow.

### Installation via Docker
git clone https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenLane.git
cd OpenLane
./quick_start.sh

### Running a Design
Follow [OpenLANE Docs](https://openlane.readthedocs.io/) for detailed workflows.
